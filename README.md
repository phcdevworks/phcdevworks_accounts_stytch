# PHCDevworks Accounts Stytch - Ruby on Rails Adapter for Stytch
PHCDevworks Accounts Stytch is an authentication system that integrates with the Stytch API to provide seamless B2B and B2C user authentication for Ruby on Rails apps. The project includes:

- **Magic Link Authentication**: Users can authenticate via secure magic links sent to their email.
- **Password Authentication**: Support for password-based login and reset flows, including registration and session management.
- **Password Reset Management**: Users can reset their passwords via email, token, existing password, or session token.
- **Organization Support**: The B2B module includes organization-specific user authentication with integration of organization IDs.
- **Service Handling**: All service actions are abstracted into service objects that handle interaction with Stytchâ€™s API for better maintainability and testability.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Robust error logging and consistent handling of service responses ensure reliability and traceability of issues.
